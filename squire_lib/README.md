## Overview
This library contains the backend library by SquireCore.
It encapsulates the tournament model that we use and implements all interal tournament logic.

## Current State
This library has been mostly stabilized; however, there are still some known changes coming.
Namely, the rest of the tournament manager model needs implemented and additional FFI features needed for the desktop are needed.

## Future Plans
Even after full stabilization, this library will continue to grow and expand as we start to offer a more expansive range of tournament services.
