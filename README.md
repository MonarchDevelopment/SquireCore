## Overview
This library contains the backend library for tournament management used by [SquireBot](https://github.com/MonarchDevelopment/SquireBot).
The goal is to allow for a series of pairing and scoring systems to be
combined in a dynamic way, allowing for on-the-fly, highly customizable
tournament structures.

## Current State
SquireCore is still very much in development.
SquireBot implemented many of the core functionalities in Python.
The features in this library are highly inspired by that implementation.

## Future Plans
Eventually, this project will be a fully-fledged backend service, not
just a library.
Due to potential time constraints, the library portion of this project
will be completed first.
After which time, work on the actual service will start.
